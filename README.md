## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è What is Pegasus Spyware?

Pegasus spyware is a sophisticated tool designed to infiltrate mobile devices, primarily iPhones. Once installed, it can access messages, calls, and other sensitive data without the user's knowledge. This software has raised significant ethical and legal questions regarding privacy and surveillance.

### Key Features of Pegasus Spyware:

- **Remote Access**: It allows attackers to gain control of a device remotely.
- **Data Exfiltration**: It can extract sensitive information, including messages and location data.
- **Stealth Mode**: Pegasus operates quietly, making it difficult for users to detect its presence.

## üîß Technical Overview

The technical architecture of Pegasus spyware involves several components that enable its functionality:

### 1. **Infection Vectors**

Pegasus can be installed on devices through various methods, including:

- **Phishing Links**: Users may receive a link that, when clicked, installs the spyware.
- **Zero-Day Exploits**: These are vulnerabilities in software that are unknown to the vendor, allowing for silent installation.

### 2. **Communication Protocols**

Once installed, Pegasus communicates with command and control servers to receive instructions and send back data. This communication often uses encrypted channels to avoid detection.

### 3. **Data Access and Control**

Pegasus can access various types of data, including:

- **Text Messages**: Both SMS and messages from apps like WhatsApp and Signal.
- **Call Logs**: Records of incoming and outgoing calls.
- **Location Tracking**: Continuous tracking of the device's location.

## üì± Other iPhone Surveillance Tools

While Pegasus is one of the most well-known spyware tools, several other applications exist that offer similar functionalities. These include:

- **Hermit Spyware**: Known for its ability to bypass security measures.
- **Xworm**: A remote access tool that can control devices and extract data.
- **TriangleDB**: A tool focused on gathering data from social media platforms.
